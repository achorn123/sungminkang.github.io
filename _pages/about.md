Hi! I’m a M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning & Data Science Track) at the University of Southern California.

My research focuses in Distributed AI and Efficient Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in reducing communication and computation costs in federated learning, and leveraging foundation models on limited resources through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. I am also currently working with Professor Sunwoo Lee.

Before studying at USC, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Sogang University in South Korea. I worked with Professor Hongseok Kim, focusing on algorithmic research and the implementation of federated learning.

Besides machine learning, I enjoy playing tennis and soccer.
